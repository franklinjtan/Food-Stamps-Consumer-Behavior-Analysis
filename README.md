# Food Stamps Consumer Behavior Analysis

# Background
SNAP provides food assistance to low-income households in the US. Despite concerns about food insecurity, SNAP households tend to spend a larger portion of their budget on unhealthy, hedonic food items. Studies have shown that SNAP participants purchase more sugary beverages, desserts, and snacks, which contribute to obesity and chronic diseases. Even after considering income and education, SNAP participants tend to have larger waists and higher obesity rates. However, the underlying psychological reasons for this behavior remain unknown. To address this gap, researchers conducted an online shopping study to explore the psychological mechanisms that drive SNAP households to buy more unhealthy food items.

# Consumer Behavior (Attention, Coherence, and Emotion Framework)
Using the ACE framework, we can draw the following conclusions regarding the differences in metal processes underlying SNAP householdsâ€™ food purchase decisions compared to non-SNAP households:
* Attention to hedonic food items. Both SNAP and non-SNAP households exhibit attention to hedonic food items, as indicated by their cravings for such food. However, SNAP households tend to have a higher level of craving for both hedonic and utilitarian food items compared to non-SNAP households. Given that we process information sequentially, it is reasonable to assume that SNAP households, due to their circumstances of food insecurity and financial constraints, may engage less in system 2 thinking (analytical and deliberative thinking) and rely more on system 1 thinking (heuristics or mental shortcuts) when making food choices. The heightened perceptibility and reliance on system 1 thinking may contribute to their higher levels of attention and craving for food items.
* Intensity of emotional responses varies between the two groups. SNAP households experience stronger cravings for both hedonic and utilitarian food items compared to non-SNAP households. This heightened emotional response can be attributed to the stressful situation SNAP households face, including food insecurity and lack of financial ability to afford food. The immediate need to make choices about acquiring or consuming food regardless of health benefits may lead SNAP households to prioritize immediate gratification.
* Coherence and its role in justifying hedonic purchases. Despite being aware of the potential negative health outcomes associated with indulging in hedonic food, SNAP households engage in implicit justifications to maintain coherence in their decision-making. This helps bridge the gap between their cravings and their beliefs about health, enabling them to find coherence and reconcile any cognitive dissonance that may arise. Our analysis reveals that SNAP households, on average, do not perceive hedonic foods as unhealthy as non-SNAP households, indicating a coherent mental process that aligns cravings with a lower perception of unhealthiness. This is further supported by the finding that SNAP households do not consider hedonic food to be better value for money compared to utilitarian food. The implicit justifications employed by SNAP households may stem from the need to maintain a sense of balance, satisfaction, and emotional well-being, even when making hedonic food choices.

# Summary Insights
These insights highlight the divergent consumption patterns, value perceptions, and food cravings between SNAP and non-SNAP households. The findings suggest that factors beyond income and education play a significant role in shaping the food choices of SNAP households. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying factors influencing these differences and design targeted strategies to address the specific needs of SNAP households in terms of food preferences and consumption patterns.
1. Based on Figure 1's T-Test Results, there is a significant difference between the types of food purchased by SNAP and non-SNAP households. SNAP households tend to buy more hedonic products but fewer utilitarian products, with higher average values for both categories.
2. From the summary results of OLS regression in Figure 3, income and education are not statistically significant predictors of the consumption patterns of SNAP households, suggesting that other unexplored factors may play a more influential role.
3. According to the analysis in Figure 4, SNAP households do not consider hedonic food to be better value for money compared to utilitarian food.
4. The analysis in Figure 6 and Figure 7 reveals that SNAP and non-SNAP households' unhealthiness perceptions of food differ. SNAP households perceive both hedonic and utilitarian products as less unhealthy than non-SNAP households.
5. For hedonic food, craving differs between SNAP and non-SNAP households. SNAP households report higher craving levels for both hedonic and utilitarian products compared to non-SNAP households.
6. The relationship between craving and unhealthiness perception for hedonic food varies for SNAP and non-SNAP households. Craving has a stronger negative correlation with unhealthiness perception among SNAP households compared to non-SNAP households.
