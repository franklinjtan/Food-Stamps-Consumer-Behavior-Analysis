# Food Stamps Consumer Behavior Analysis

# Background
SNAP provides food assistance to low-income households in the US. Despite concerns about food insecurity, SNAP households tend to spend a larger portion of their budget on unhealthy, hedonic food items. Studies have shown that SNAP participants purchase more sugary beverages, desserts, and snacks, which contribute to obesity and chronic diseases. Even after considering income and education, SNAP participants tend to have larger waists and higher obesity rates. However, the underlying psychological reasons for this behavior remain unknown. To address this gap, researchers conducted an online shopping study to explore the psychological mechanisms that drive SNAP households to buy more unhealthy food items.
