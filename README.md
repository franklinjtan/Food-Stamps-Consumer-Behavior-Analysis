# Food Stamps Consumer Behavior Analysis

# Background
SNAP provides food assistance to low-income households in the US. Despite concerns about food insecurity, SNAP households tend to spend a larger portion of their budget on unhealthy, hedonic food items. Studies have shown that SNAP participants purchase more sugary beverages, desserts, and snacks, which contribute to obesity and chronic diseases. Even after considering income and education, SNAP participants tend to have larger waists and higher obesity rates. However, the underlying psychological reasons for this behavior remain unknown. To address this gap, researchers conducted an online shopping study to explore the psychological mechanisms that drive SNAP households to buy more unhealthy food items.

# Summary Insights
* These insights highlight the divergent consumption patterns, value perceptions, and food cravings between SNAP and non-SNAP households. The findings suggest that factors beyond income and education play a significant role in shaping the food choices of SNAP households. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying factors influencing these differences and design targeted strategies to address the specific needs of SNAP households in terms of food preferences and consumption patterns.
1. Based on Figure 1's T-Test Results, there is a significant difference between the types of food purchased by SNAP and non-SNAP households. SNAP households tend to buy more hedonic products but fewer utilitarian products, with higher average values for both categories.
2. From the summary results of OLS regression in Figure 3, income and education are not statistically significant predictors of the consumption patterns of SNAP households, suggesting that other unexplored factors may play a more influential role.
3. According to the analysis in Figure 4, SNAP households do not consider hedonic food to be better value for money compared to utilitarian food.
4. The analysis in Figure 6 and Figure 7 reveals that SNAP and non-SNAP households' unhealthiness perceptions of food differ. SNAP households perceive both hedonic and utilitarian products as less unhealthy than non-SNAP households.
5. For hedonic food, craving differs between SNAP and non-SNAP households. SNAP households report higher craving levels for both hedonic and utilitarian products compared to non-SNAP households.
6. The relationship between craving and unhealthiness perception for hedonic food varies for SNAP and non-SNAP households. Craving has a stronger negative correlation with unhealthiness perception among SNAP households compared to non-SNAP households.
